# Documentation
* Latex Template for documentation as per Lakshay's Guidelines  
* Everything is generated automatically except the font  
* Only the relevant portions under sections and subsections need to be filled  
* Also Project Title and team member names need to be filled up  
* Project is under Prof. L. Garg :wink:
* Compile twice using `pdflatex documentation.tex` for best results  
  (ignore errors, I don't know how to solve them{yet})
